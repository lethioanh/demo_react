**Getting Started**

*How do I set this up?*

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

# Get the latest snapshot
$ git clone https://github.com/lethioanh/demo_react.git

# Change directory
$ cd demo_react

# Run npm install to install all the node modules we are using.
$ npm install


You can now run the app as normal:

$ npm start

**Add Dependencies and plugins**

We will use **webpack** bundler in these tutorials so let's install **webpack** and **webpack-dev-server**.

- *npm install webpack --save*
- *npm install webpack-dev-server --save*

Since we want to use React, we need to install it first. The **--save** command will add these packages to **package.json** file.

- *npm install react --save*
- *npm install react-dom --save*

We already mentioned that we will need some **babel** plugins so let's install it too.

- *npm install babel-core*
- *npm install babel-loader*
- *npm install babel-preset-react*
- *npm install babel-preset-es2015*
